      <td align="left"><p>To an intelligence fully and acutely alive, its own time must, I think, be more interesting than any other. The sentimental, the scholastic, the speculative temperament may look before or after with longing or regret; but that sanity of mind which is practical and productive must find its most agreeable sensations in the data to which it is intimately and inexorably related. The light upon Greek literature and art for which we study Greek history, the light upon Roman history for which we study Latin literature and art, are admirable to us in very exact proportion as we study them of our ends. To every man and very nation that really breathes, true vitality of soul depends upon saying to one&rsquo;s self, with a emotion of equivalent intensity to the emotion of patriotism celebrated in Scott&rsquo;s familiar lines, this is my own, my native era and environment. Culture is impossible apart from cosmopolitanism, but self-respect is more indispensable even than culture. French art alone at the present time possesses absolute self-respect. It possesses this quality in an eminent, in even an excessive agree; but it possesses it, and it virtue of it is endued with preservative quality that saves it from the emptiness of imitation and the exertion of dilettantism. It has, in consequence, escaped that recrudescence of the primitive and inchoate known in England and among ourselves as pre-Raphaelitism. It has escaped also that almost abject worship of classic models which Winckelmann and Canova made universal Germany and Italy not to speak of its echoes elsewhere. </p>

It has always stood on its own feet, and, however lacking in the higher qualities of imaginative initiative, on the one hand, and however addicted to the academic and the traditional on the other, has always both respected its aesthetic heritage and contributed something of its own thereto. <br>
Why should one feel the same quick interest, the same instinctive pride in his time as in his country? Is not sympathy with what is modern, instant, actual, and apposite a fair parallel of patriotism? Neglect of other times in the &quot;heir of all the ages&rdquo; is analogous to chauvinism, and indicative of as ill judged an attitude as that provincial blindness to other contemporary points of view and systems of philosophy than one&rsquo;s own. Culture is equally hostile to both, and in art culture is as important a factor as it is in less special fields of activity and endeavor. But in art, as elsewhere, culture is a means to an actual, present end, and the pre-Raphaelite sentiment that dictates mere reproduction of what was once genuine expression is as sterile as servile imitation of exotic miles of though, dress and demeanor is universally felt to be. The past the antique, the renaissance, the classic, and romantic ideals are to be used, not adopted; in the spirit of Goethe, at once the most original of modern men and the most saturated with culture, exhibited in his famous saying: &ldquo;Nothing do I call my own which having inherited U have not reconquered for myself.&rdquo; It would indeed be a singular thing were the field of aesthetics the only one uninvaded by the scientific spirit of the time.</td>
